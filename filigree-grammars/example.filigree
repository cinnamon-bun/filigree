# A Filigree file is a list of text-expansion rules.

# Define a rule.  The right side is like a string but without quote marks.

# Randomly choose one of several options with square brackets and "/"
name = Captain [Moss/Pebble/Twig]

# Reference another rule with angled brackets
greeting = Hello to <name> who is a <job>.

# To make things occur rarely, use empty choices.
# The more empty choices, the less often the other choices will appear.
greeting2 = Hi [there /]<name>.     # "there " happens 1/2 of the time
greeting3 = Hi [there ////]<name>.  # "there " happens 1/5 of the time

# Choices can contain nested choices and references
greeting4 = [Hi [there /]<name>/Hello], how are you today?

# Or, choices can be written across multiple lines instead of using "/" on a single line.
# You can't mix these; choose either "/" or multi-line.
# Multi-line choices ignore blank lines, which means you can't use them to
# make rare choices like [rare////].
# Indentation and whitespace around each line is ignored.

# This is not allowed -- the brackets have to be on their own lines:
#   foo = [bar
#      baz
#      quuz]

# Trailing whitespace on a line is removed.
# To make whitespace matter, put it inside choice brackets.
# You can also make a zero-length string this way.

# Each rule declaration must be on its own line.  TODO: allow them to span lines
# Blank lines are ignored.
# The equals sign must have one space on each side.  TODO: fix this
# Rule names can contain letters, numbers, dashes, and underscores, but not spaces.  Capitalization matters.
# References can't contain anything nested inside the angle brackets, only plain old rule names
#   (no "<[cat/dog]Name>")
# If you see angle brackets in the output, it means you're referencing a rule that doesn't exist.
#   (like "Hello <thisRuleDoesNotExist>")
# If a rule name is defined more than once, the last one wins.
# Besides that, rules can be declared in any order.
# Set your text editor to make-file or Python language mode for approximate syntax highlighting.
